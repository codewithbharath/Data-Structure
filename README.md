# Data Structures Library
    Welcome to the Data Structures Library! This library provides implementations of various data structures commonly used in computer science. Whether you're a student learning about data structures or a developer looking for efficient implementations, this library has got you covered.

# Overview
Understanding data structures is fundamental in computer science. They are essential tools for organizing and managing data efficiently. This library aims to provide clear, well-documented implementations of commonly used data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

# Implemented Data Structures
Array: A dynamic array implementation with support for resizing.
Linked List: Both singly and doubly linked list implementations.
Stack: A stack data structure supporting push, pop, and peek operations.
Queue: Implementations of both a simple queue and a priority queue.
Tree: Binary search tree and AVL tree implementations.
Graph: Adjacency list representation for graph data structure.
